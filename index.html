                    Welcome to my bio page! Hopefully there's a nugget or two in here worth holding on to. Otherwise... such is life!
                    <p>About me, hm? Well. I grew up in suburban Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I went to a small Christian high school, which is nice if you're into that kind of thing. At Louisiana State University I studied Political Science (with a concentration in International Politics). I graduated cum laude in 2002.</p>
                    <p>I began writing religious and political satire for local magazines and peforming standup comedy in Baton Rouge & New Orleans. In 2005 packed my Corolla and moved to Brooklyn, NY.</p>
                    <p>Brooklyn was a great place to spend my mid- & late-20's... early-30's even! But then it gets a little rough to exist there (unless you're making bank--which I certainly wasn't. I spent most of my time doing standup, partying, and producing live events (mostly standup showcases).</p>
                    <p>My partner is doing her PhD at ASU, so we're ostensibly here for as much; honestly it was nice to get out of NYC after nearly ten years. Now I mostly do yoga and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. In fact, I was teaching both before taking a hiatus to take this class. So... huzzah? Lorm ipsum, indeed!</p>
                    <p>PS: "Ches" is short for "Chesley". And yes, I do play chess. I played tournament chess for like, ten years. I still play now and again, but computers have taken all the fun out of the game!! #SkyNet</p>
